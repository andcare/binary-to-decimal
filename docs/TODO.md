# TODO List for Binary to Decimal Calculator

## Tasks

- [ ] Understand the Binary System and its Logic
  - [x] Research and take note of this
- [ ] Understand the mathematical calcuations behind the convertion

## Coding Task

- [x] Make a components for this project
    * [x] Button component
    * [x] Input component
    * [x] Output component
- [x] Style the said components
    * [x] Button component
    * [x] Input component
    * [x] Output component

- [x] Allow the User to enter **_Strings_** of up the **_8 Binary Digit_** in
      any sequence

- [x] Binary Digits are 1s and 0s

- [ ] Display its **_Decimal Equivalent_**

  - [x] User must be notified if anything other that 1 or 0 was entered
  - [ ] User views the result in a single output field containing the
        decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered

- [x] Arrays will not be used to contain the binary digit entered by the User

- [ ] Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the
      sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function.


1. [x] Make sure that the input is a number and only 1s and 0s to be placed.
2. Take the input as string and loop the string, maximum of 8 characters.
